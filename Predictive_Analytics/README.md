To address this business challenge, two classification methodologies were employed: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Classifiers.


<li>The initial phase involved extracting and storing data within a dataframe.</li>
<li>Subsequently, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to comprehend the attributes better.</li>
<li>Data cleansing was executed, followed by the identification of predictor and target variables.</li>
<li>Feature scaling and encoding procedures were applied.</li>
<li>The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets.</li>
<li>We implemented two distinct machine learning techniques.</li>
<li>Outcomes were evaluated and compared, leading to the selection of the optimal model based on superior accuracy.</li>
