# Exploring Bank Marketing Campaigns: Insights and Strategies through Data Analysis and Visualization
In this project, bank marketing campaigns' data has been explored to gain insights into the campaign's performance and 
identify effective campaign strategies.

To visualize my findings, a Tableau dashboard was created, that includes visualization sheets.

Each sheet provides different perspectives on the data and can be used to gain insights into different aspects of the campaign.

#### Data Cleaning
Python was used in the data cleansing process to make sure that the data is suitable for analysis.

Data types were checked to ensure that they were appropriate for the variables being measured. This involved converting any incorrect data types, such as strings to numerical data types, where necessary.

Missing values and outliers were checked by using various techniques

Duplicates were checked and some columns were renamed to improve the readability and accuracy of the data.

Categorical data were converted by utilizing the technique of binarization, such as responses of "yes" or "no", into binary data that is more suitable for analysis. This was achieved by assigning the values of 1 and 0 to "yes" and "no", respectively.
