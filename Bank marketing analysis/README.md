# Exploring Bank Marketing Campaigns: Insights and Strategies through Data Analysis and Visualization
In this project, bank marketing campaigns' data has been explored to gain insights into the campaign's performance and 
identify effective campaign strategies. To visualize my findings, a Tableau dashboard was created, that includes visualization sheets.
Each sheet provides different perspectives on the data and can be used to gain insights into different aspects of the campaign.
Python was used in the data cleansinh process to make sure that the data is suitable for analysis
