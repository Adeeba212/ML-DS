### About
This movie recommender system is based on content based recommendation.Metadata such as ‘genres’, ‘actor’ , ‘overview/plot’ can provide us a good deal of insight on understanding users preferences and help recommend movies or TV shows according to this. It helps get a good gauge of users likes/dislikes.

<b>Content Based Recommendation System</b>: It uses attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie or show, he/she might like a movie or a show similar to it.

### Observations
Content-based recommendation systems prove highly effective when suggesting movies based on attributes such as genres, actors, and overviews. The accuracy of content-based filtering thrives when utilizing fields like genres, cast, and crews, as they furnish comprehensive insights into user preferences. Demographic filtering which just makes use of fields like popularity, budget and revenue, these fields don’t provide any specific information which could help us in determining the preferences/likes of user.

However, content-based filtering's scope is limited to existing user interests, disregarding communal sentiments about items. Consequently, there's a possibility of occasional subpar item recommendations, since the system doesn't account for collective user opinions.
